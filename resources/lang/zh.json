    "Hong Kong DHL is generally through the Shenzhen agent customs clearance delivery to Hong Kong, and then by Hong Kong DHL directly on the plane to the world. Under normal circumstances, mainland DHL will send freight directly to the nearest international airport, such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, etc., directly on the plane, and then shipped to all parts of the world. Therefore, under normal circumstances, the speed of DHL to the mainland will be about 1-2 days faster than that of DHL in Hong Kong. However, because the international flights in the mainland are not very developed, many international flights are also transited through Hong Kong. Therefore, in addition to Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan and other regions, mainland DHL is faster than Hong Kong DHL, if you go to the Middle East, Africa, Europe and America and other places, There is basically no difference in the timeliness of the two, because in some relatively distant areas, mainland DHL also needs to first send the goods to Hong Kong and then operate. Domestic DHL generally receives the express, there will be a tracking number, which can be immediately queried on the DHL official website, and if it is sent to Hong Kong DHL, the tracking number must be generated through the replacement of the tracking number, which can be queried on the DHL official website, or the original tracking number can be queried by the sender's reference information on the DHL official website. Once the goods are delivered to DHL, other delivery times, insurance clause 2 basically makes no difference. Hong Kong DHL and domestic DHL that is safer, is it risky to take Hong Kong DHL? After the goods are delivered to DHL, the safety and risk of the two are basically no different, but because the goods sent to DHL in Hong Kong are delivered to DHL in Hong Kong by the mainland's domestic agency company, so as long as the regular agency company is selected, there is basically no risk.": "香港DHL一般是通过深圳代理报关发货到香港，再由香港DHL直接上飞机送到世界各地。而大陆DHL一般情况下，都会将货运直接送往就近的国际机场，例如广州，上海，深圳等直接上飞机，再运往世界各地。所以一般情况下，寄大陆DHL会比香港DHL的速度快上1-2天左右，但是，由于大陆的国际航班并不是很发达，很多国际航班也是经过香港中转操作，所以，除了东南亚，韩国，日本等地区大陆DHL比香港DHL快外，如果去中东，非洲，欧美等地方，两者的时效基本没有区别，因为在去一些比较远的地区，大陆的DHL也一样要先货物发到香港再进行操作。四，查询单号的区别国内DHL一般一收到快件，就会有单号，当即可以在DHL官方网站查询，而如果寄送香港DHL，就必须经过换单生成运单号，可以在DHL官方网站进行运单查询，也可以在DHL官方网站按原单号进行“按发件人参考信息查询”，一旦货物交由DHL，其他的运送时间，保险条款2者基本就没有任何区别了。香港DHL与国内DHL那种更安全，走香港DHL有风险吗？在货物交给DHL之后，二者的安全性与风险性基本没有什么不同，但是由于寄香港DHL是由大陆国内的代理公司代理将货物交给香港DHL，所以，只要选择好正规的代理公司，基本没有什么风险。",

    "It is a relatively monopolistic industry, coupled with underdeveloped domestic freight resources, so the current price of DHL in the mainland is relatively high.

It can be seen why many customers prefer to choose Hong Kong DHL rather than mainland DHL in order to save costs. Hong Kong is a free trade port, and DHL transshipment in Hong Kong generally does not require customs declaration, which saves customers from cumbersome procedures and valuable time.": "属于比较垄断性行业，再加上国内货运资源不发达，所以目前大陆DHL的价格相对比较高。而香港作为国际货运中转地，而且竞争力相对很大，所以香港DHL的价格比较低。以一分0.5KGS的文件为例，香港DHL与大陆DHL的价格可能相差1倍左右的价格。可见，为什么很多客户为了节省成本，宁愿选择香港DHL而不选择大陆DHL。香港属于自由贸易港，在香港DHL中转的快递一般不需要报关，这样就为客户省掉了繁琐的手续，节省了宝贵的时间。",
