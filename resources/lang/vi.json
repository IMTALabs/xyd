    "It is a relatively monopolistic industry, coupled with underdeveloped domestic freight resources, so the current price of DHL in the mainland is relatively high. As an international freight transfer place, Hong Kong is relatively competitive, so the price of DHL in Hong Kong is relatively low. Taking a 0.5KGS document as an example, the price of DHL in Hong Kong and mainland DHL may differ by about 1 times the price. It can be seen why many customers prefer to choose Hong Kong DHL rather than mainland DHL in order to save costs.
